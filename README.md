# Homework 12 - Employee Content Management System

## Description

I created an employee content management system.  I use inquirer to determine whether a user wants to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.  Based on the user input, I interact with my mysql database to select or update the requested tables.
